# Grocery_Store_Simulation_April2024
This project simulates a grocery store to optimize the number of cashiers, minimizing idle time and overtime by using linked lists for shoppers and a queue for checkout lanes. The program was developed with 2 classmates, Elias & Shree over the month of April. Though the project was originally created on replit, I imported the project to github using clion.

**Project Requirements:**
- Store is open from 9am - 9pm (720 minutes)
- Every minute, 1-3 customers enter the store
    - Number of items added to cart is assigned
    - Each item takes 30-60 seconds to find
- Once the customer is done shopping, they must checkout
- If customers are in store after the store closes, cashiers must be paid overtime




**Initial Requirements:**
